<p>BeArt is committed to providing a diversified platform for art trading and exhibitions while serving as an ecological economic entity. By combining various encrypted assets like NFTs, RWAs, and tokens with offline real-world artworks, we have established a self-sustaining, cyclical economic system.</p>
<p>Initially, the platform will provide infrastructure and services for art trading and exhibitions, along with launching a Genesis NFT series related to overall platform governance. As the platform matures and user base expands, the ecological economic entity will introduce a token model to enhance economic vitality, creating additional value and returns for users, creators, and investors.</p>
<p>In terms of spatial layout, the scope of the ecological economic entity is broader than just trading and exhibiting artworks. It involves asset creation, distribution, trading, management, and reuse, forming a closed-loop economic system. Encrypted assets act as a link connecting various business types, facilitating effective flow and maximization of value for artworks and art derivatives.</p>
<p>The financial characteristics inherent in RWA assets first need to enhance market liquidity (including the development of the NFT art market), which is an essential step for BeArt&rsquo;s transition to a comprehensive platform.</p>
<p>We will initially launch the platform&rsquo;s Genesis NFT series—Visionary Club—which, while not in RWA asset form, represents an important step in the platform&rsquo;s exploration of combining traditional art markets with encrypted markets, serving as an early implementation in our project planning.</p>
<p>After the release of the Genesis NFTs, BeArt will introduce a core feature—the RWA Asset Bank. This platform will be used to enhance the efficiency of funds and transactions for both buyers and sellers, expand into more commercial scenarios, create more value for encrypted assets, and ensure the security of transaction attributes.</p>
<p>The RWA Asset Bank will offer two main types of services: financial derivative services for artworks and value-added financial services for collectors, while also providing sufficient creative scenes for platform artists.</p>

<td>RWA Collection</td>
<td>RWA Collection, meticulously crafted by BeArt using the advanced CATALOGUE Authentication System, aims to provide a unique collection of physical artworks based on their genetic identity. This authentication not only ensures the uniqueness of the artworks but also overcomes the limitations of physical space, allowing the collection to freely circulate globally. Through BeArt Gallery, users can easily search, filter, and purchase desired RWA artworks. All transactions and artwork information on this platform are transparently displayed on the blockchain, ensuring the security and reliability of transactions while providing collectors with a decentralized ecosystem for art collection and trading.</td>

<tr>
<td>RWA Derivatives（RWAD）</td>
<td>Due to the high cultural value inherent in RWA collections, they often command significant worth, which also implies a higher market entry barrier. For potential buyers and sellers, this higher threshold can impede transaction efficiency and success rates. To address this, BeArt has expanded upon the RWA Collection by introducing the RWA Derivatives product line. The RWAD series includes RWA Options and RWA Fractions, offering options and fractional ownership investment opportunities based on the foundational value assets of RWA Collection,RWA Options inherit characteristics from traditional financial options, allowing investors to purchase or sell artworks at predetermined prices in the future, thus hedging market fluctuation risks and promoting value discovery in the NFT market. RWA Fractions represent a unique innovation in the blockchain domain, enabling users to combine and divide ownership rights of individual or grouped artworks. This allows users to participate in high-value art investments with minimal capital, enjoying high returns and low risks associated with art investment.</td>

<tr>
<td>Art RWA Insurance</td>
<td>To enhance collectors&rsquo; confidence in art investments and increase the attractiveness of art RWA in the market, BeArt has introduced targeted Art RWA Insurance services. This service provides comprehensive insurance coverage for collectors through precise art valuation, effectively reducing investment risks. Not only does this protect collectors&rsquo; investments, but it also brings greater stability and prosperity to the entire art market. Through this innovative approach, BeArt is dedicated to establishing a safer and more trustworthy environment for art collection and investment, fostering the long-term and healthy development of art as RWA assets.</td>
